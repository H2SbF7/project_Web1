About the Product:
 Description: A Clinique classic. Not quite lipstick, not quite gloss—its texture is more like a balm you can easily layer.
 Details: Transparent pigment glides on a sheer, glossy slip of lightweight color. Emollient-rich formula gives lips a sleek, moist finish. Cult-classic Black Honey is famous for its chameleon-like ability to flatter all skin tones yet look different on everyone. Don’t be fooled by the way it looks in the tube. The sheer formula is part of its mystique. It’s also very forgiving—you don’t even need a mirror to put it on.
